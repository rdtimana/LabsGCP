### 🔧 Replace the contents of `faa.model` with the following code

```
connection: "bigquery_public_data_looker"
# include all views in this project
include: "*.view"
include: "/z_tests/*.lkml"

explore: airports {
  group_label: "FAA"
}

explore: flights {
  group_label: "FAA"
  description: "Start here for information about flights!"
  join: carriers {
    type: left_outer
    sql_on: ${flights.carrier} = ${carriers.code} ;;
    relationship: many_to_one
  }

  join: aircraft {
    type: left_outer
    sql_on: ${flights.tail_num} = ${aircraft.tail_num} ;;
